# simple-RSA
Basic RSA implementation using GMP. It's not really secure, since the 2 original prime number are chose using a very bad random num generator, I might try and make it better if I have the time.
How to use:
To encrypt:
Write the text you want to encrypt in the input.txt, then run the RSA program. It will automaticaly generates a module, a public and private key.
You will find your encrypted text in the output.txt file.
To decrypt:
Paste the text in the output.txt file, and run the Decrypt program. You will be asked to input your module and your private key. Once that is done, your decrypted text will be shown on the terminal and in the decrypt.txt
